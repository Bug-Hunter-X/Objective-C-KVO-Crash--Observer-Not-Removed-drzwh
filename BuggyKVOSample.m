In Objective-C, a subtle bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not removed properly before the observed object is deallocated, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  Specifically, if the observer is a strong reference to the observed object, a retain cycle might occur, preventing the object from being deallocated.  The `removeObserver:` method must always be called.
